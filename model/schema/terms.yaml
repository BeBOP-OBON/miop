  samp_name:
    is_a: investigation field
    title: sample name
    description: A local identifier or name that for the material sample used for
      extracting nucleic acids, and subsequent sequencing. It can refer either to
      the original material collected or to any derived sub-samples. It can have any
      format, but we suggest that you make it concise, unique and consistent within
      your lab, and as informative as possible. INSDC requires every sample name from
      a single Submitter to be unique. Use of a globally unique identifier for the
      field source_mat_id is recommended in addition to sample_name.

    title: experimental factor
    description: Experimental factors are essentially the variable aspects of an experiment
      design which can be used to describe an experiment, or set of experiments, in
      an increasingly detailed manner. This field accepts ontology terms from Experimental
      Factor Ontology (EFO) and/or Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). For
      a browser of EFO (v 2.95) terms, please see http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/EFO;
