    title: methodology category 
    description: >
      Methodology category which the uploaded protocol belongs to. This links to the associated 
      methodology categories which precede and succeed it in the workflow, to facilitate the linking of protocols 
      into entire workflows, while keeping granularity and flexibility. This will enable the mixing and matching of 
      protocol modules from various uploaded workflows
